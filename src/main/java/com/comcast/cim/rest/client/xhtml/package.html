This package provides a foundation for building XHTML hypermedia API
clients. The major notion of a hypermedia API is that clients start from
a known entry-point URL and proceed to use the API by following links
and submitting forms--exactly the way humans do when they use the web.
This style of API provides a lot of server-side flexibility in terms of
controlling its own URL space, since clients never construct URLs
themselves. Instead, clients construct their HTTP requests by following
the existing, standardized semantics for HTTP &lt;a&gt; and &lt;form&gt;
elements, which means the mechanisms for those requests are under the
server's control.
